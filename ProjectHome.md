# Description #
This project uses the library from litJson (http://litjson.sourceforge.net/).

The original library from litJson does not work with .NET Compact Framework. I have made a little modification, so that it can be used with .NET Compact Framework. I have tested with .NET Compact Framework 2.0.

I hope this library will benefit you guys out there !.

# Instruction #
Please see 'TestJson' Project inside jsonnetcf-full.zip

# Setting Up 'TestJson' Project #

1. include /JsonSerializer/bin/Debug/JsonSerializer.dll

2. include /LitJson/bin/Debug/litJson.dll (You have to use litJson.dll from my project, because I have modified it.)

3. Now you may run the project

4. The part showing how to use JsonSerializer is in Form1.cs.

Any problem please contact me (tanin47@yahoo.com)
